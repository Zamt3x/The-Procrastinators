### Local testing/deployment requirements

- Application uses PHP, XAMPP works for local testing.
- Host machine needs a local install of Python (3.xx) which is accessible though\
typical terminal/cmd fashion (ex. terminal: python -args).
- Access /website/ of application through localhost on port specified by starting\
the Apache service of XAMPP.

### Extra/specific requirements for server deployment

- Server must include stack of type: PHP.
- An alias pointing to /website/, as it is the heart of the application.
- /tools/, .gitignore, LICENSE and README.md should be removed as they are\
inconsequential to hosting the application.
